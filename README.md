## Description
*Updated*
We were tasked this week with creating a searchable weather site where you type in the city and the result populates with a 5 day forecast. We were to use a weather API (I used openweathermap) to pull the data. I was able to successfully pull the current days weather for a given city. You will then find (when you scroll down) the 5 day forecast for your searched city. Thank you!
